			tree: tree
		});
	}

	onLeafMouseClick(event, leaf) {

	}

	render() {
		return (
			<InfinityMenu
				tree={this.state.tree}

				onLeafMouseUp={this.onLeafMouseUp}/*optional*/
				maxLeaves={5}/*optional*/

# Properties


#### tree(Array)

A tree to represent the folder structure.
Here is the example data you could pass into the tree props.
```js
[
	{
		name: "menu1", /*require*/
		id: 1, /*require*/
		isOpen: true, /*require*/
		customComponent: YOUR_OWN_COMPONENT_FOR_MENU,
		children: [
			{
				name: "submenu1",
				id: 1,
				isOpen: true,
				customComponent: YOUR_OWN_COMPONENT_FOR_SUB_MENU,
				children: [
					{
						name: "item1-1",
						id: 1
					},
					{
						name: "item1-2",
						id: 2
					}
				]
			},
			{
				name: "submenu2",
				id: 2,
				isOpen: true,
				customComponent: YOUR_OWN_COMPONENT_FOR_SUB_MENU,
				children: [
					{
						name: "item2-1",
						id: 1
					}
				]
			}
		]
	},
	{
		name: "menu2", /*require*/
		id: 2, /*require*/
		isOpen: true, /*require*/
		customComponent: YOUR_OWN_COMPONENT_FOR_MENU,
		children: [
			{
				name: "item3-1",
				id: 1
			}
		]
	}
];
```

#### disableDefaultHeaderContent (boolean)
A boolean to set if user want to display the default header search input. If user pass in headerContent, the default header will be disabled.

#### headerContent(React Component)
Subcomponent rendered above the tree.

`headerContent` is passed in to `InfinityMenu`. It is rendered above the tree subcomponent.

#### headerProps(object)
Additional props for headerContent.

* `headerProps` is an optional prop of InfinityMenu. The props in this object are passed as props to a `headerContent` component. This is useful when extending InfinityMenu.

Passing the following into InfinityMenu as the `headerProps` prop sets the `title` prop on the headerContent component.
```js
{
	title: "my great title"
}
```


#### customComponentMappings (object)
A mapping that let user to pass in customComponent as string.
```js
var myComponentMappings = {
    "MyComponent1": MyComponent1,
    "MyComponent2": MyComponent2
}
```

#### customComponent(React Component)
A custom React component the user can pass in.
  * As the `customComponent` at the node level, you will receive props `key`,  `onClick`, `name`, `isOpen`, `data` and `isSearching`.
  * As the `customComponent` at the leaf level, you will receive props `key`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onClick`, `name`, `icon` and `data`.

	Example of `customComponent`
	```js
	class Node extends React.Component {
	    render() {
	        return (
	            <div key={this.props.key} onClick={this.props.onClick}>
	                <label>{this.props.name}</label>
	            </div>
	        );
	    }
	}
	```

#### filter(function)[node, searchInput]
By default, when the menu is in searching mode, it will filter all nodes by whether their `name` is equal to the current `searchInput`. If the node `name` is equal to the `searchInput`, then the node will pass the filter and be displayed in tree (if it fails the filter, it will not be displayed in the tree).

This allows the user to specify their own filtering criteria. When the menu is in search mode, every node will be run against the `filter()` function:
* If the function returns `true`, the node will pass the filter, and be displayed in the tree.
* If the function returns `false`, the node will fail the filter, and __will not__ be displayed in the tree.

The function takes the following arguments:
* ```node (object)``` is the folder(node) the user clicked on. Includes the following properties: `id`, `name`, `isOpen` and `children`.
* ```searchInput (string)``` The current search term

#### emptyTreeComponent (React Component)
If the `tree` prop is an empty array or if the menu is in searching mode and no nodes match the filter, then the tree is considered "empty".

By default, nothing will be displayed in an empty tree.

However, if this prop is passed in, the specified component will be rendered when the tree is empty.

This allows you have a very customized "empty tree" message/image.

#### emptyTreeComponentProps (object)
Allows you to specify props to pass to the `emptyTreeComponent`.

By default, this is an empty object.


#### onNodeMouseClick(function)[event, tree, node, level, keyPath]
This function will get call when user click on the folder(node).
The function arguments include ```event```, ```tree```, ```node``` and ```level```.
* ```event``` is the mouse click event.
* ```tree``` is the updated tree, you should update your own tree accordingly.
* ```node``` is the folder(node) the user clicked on. Including the id, name, isOpen and children.
* ```level``` is the distance from the root.
* ```keyPath``` is the path from root to current node


#### onLeafMouseClick(function)[event, leaf]
Bind to the onClick on the leaf.
This function will get call when user click on the item(leaf).
The function arguments include ```event```, ```leaf```.
* ```event``` is the click event.
* ```leaf``` is the item user clicked on. Includes name, id, keyPath and all data the user inputs when they pass in the tree.


#### onLeafMouseDown(function)[event, leaf]

This function will get call when user mouse down on the item(leaf).
The function arguments include ```event```, ```leaf```.
* ```event``` is the click event.

The function arguments include ```event```, ```leaf```.
* ```event``` is the click event.

Sets the maximum number of leaf to show initially.  Also used as an increment when then load more is pressed.


#### shouldComponentUpdate(function) [currProps, currState, nextProps, nextState]
